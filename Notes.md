## Intro

- Introduce self
- Explosion of AI technology: feeling like the world is going to change
- Usually prepare slides, but today we are going to be spending all of our time in code (Jupyter notebook in codespaces)
- This is not about tools, this is about mindset. This is a about process. Otherwise this talk will get stale
- My only tools are: A github repo, jupyter notebook, and GPT-4 (in iOS)

## The SDLC

- Discovery: What is the problem we are trying to solve. REQUIRES user input, market research, etc.
- Design: What does a solution to the problem look like. UI/UX focus
- Architecture: What are the technical components of our solution, and how do they fit together
- Project breakdown: Taking our software design and breaking it down into units of work consumable for a team
- Development: How to use AI tool during your development life cycle
- Testing: AI-Driven testing of our software solution
- Deployment: Using AI insights to automate code deployments to our environments, including environment-readiness checks
- Maintenance: Leveraging AI to continuously monitoring our solutions

## Example Problem

- Story of music teacher finding taxes complicated, and existing CRMs are not well tailored to this problem.

### Things to incorporate

- Prompt Engingeering
- Context window size
- Mindset: The Key is Process + AI
