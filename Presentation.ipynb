    "## Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to tackle discovery as a business that involve many different kinds of stakeholders.\n",
    "But at the end of the day, the challenge is the same: \n",
    "> In the simplest possible terms, what is the problem we are trying to solve?\n",

    "Process-wise, what framework(s) can we use tackle this challenge? Here's one: The 5 Whys Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img height=\"250px\" src=\"./photos/5Whys.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we may ask our users a list of questions about their experience, and from those list of questions drill down using a 5 Whys technique that help us at the root problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what questions should we start asking? Let's see what ChatGPT says...\n",
    "\n",
    "<img height=\"500px\" src=\"./photos/ListofQuestions.jpeg\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "These 10 questions are pretty good start. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pop on a quick call with the musician and get some answers. I'm going to use a video-calling software that does auto-transcriptions so I can copy & paste our discussion back into ChatGPT. This transcript record is pretty ugly, so I've asked ChatGPT to clean it up a bit (I've also edited some of the responses to protect the identity of the musician). \n",
    "\n",
    "Already, you can see some useful insights in these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img height=\"500px\" src=\"./photos/ModifiedTranscript.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest takeaways are:\n",
    "- Taxes are confusing, but he's using WealthSimple Tax to sort out a lot of the details for him\n",
    "- Calculating out-of-town transportation expenses are still a pain point\n",
    "- Right now he keeps his receipts in a shoebox and uploads them to the cloud, then reviews them every so often.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already narrowed down the problem: \"Canada's tax system is confusing for musicians -> Tracking the out-of-town transportation costs are painful\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue with the 5 whys on this problem. Again, I've ask ChatGPT to format the transcript and clean up the wording a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img height=\"500px\" src=\"./photos/5WhysExample.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we can see is that his gigs are stored in one system (his calendar) and the receipts are stored in a separate system (photos in the cloud), or not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us with one final problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./photos/ProblemStatement.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other steps to the discovery process, like finding alternative solutions in the market, creating a business case, etc. But so far, by combining the 5 Whys framework with ChatGPT, we have:\n",
    "1. Created a standard template of questions to ask our users during the discovery process.\n",
    "2. Streamlined the analysis of our discussions.\n",
    "3. Worked together - User + Us + AI - to clearly define the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is all of this possible without ChatGPT? Of course! But using ChatGPT helped us turn one 10 minute phone call into soemthing immediately actionable!"
